# Memory Game Project
This memory game is developed to meet basic criteria of the Udacity course project. The goal is to match 8 pairs of cards to reveal all the cards face up, which is achieved by “flipping” the card and finding two cards with the same symbol.

* [Instructions](#instructions)
Cards will flip open when the player clicks on them. Players may not open more than two cards at a time. When two open cards match, they will stay faced up. If the two open cards do not match, they will flip back over. 

The game will keep track of how long it takes you to complete every match and will provide you a star rating, associated with the number of moves you made.

3 Stars: 16 moves or less
2 Stars: 32 moves or less
1 star: 33+ moves

When all Pairs are found, a summary of your achievement will appear stating your time, moves, and stars.
